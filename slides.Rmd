### Teaching at a liberal arts college

- High quality **undergrad** teaching is expected

  - At Carleton, we get strong support from the Administration
  
- Strong students 

  - often have broad academic interests
  
  - but math/stat background can vary

.right-column[
### Teaching at a liberal arts college
- Building a math/stat community is important

  - faculty are accessible to students outside of class
  
  - help with internship/career/grad school advice, letters of recommendation
  
  - engage in social events

### Who we teach at Carleton


- Our statistics majors

- Students seeking

  - a distribution requirement (a "quantitative reasoning" course)
  
  - a prerequisite for a methods class (e.g. econ, poli sci)

- Non-majors wanting to enhance their stats/data science knowledge

- These groups are not mutually exclusive

### Research with students at Carleton

- Most years I run a "senior comprehensive" project (capstone course)

  - group of 4-6 senior stat majors, 2 terms
  

- Carleton also provides summer funding for **students** doing research with faculty

### Research expecations (for tenure)

- Need to demonstrate a commitment to scholarship and intellectual growth

  - no quota on production
  
  - may also include pedagogy and student research, consulting, package development
  
  - make sure mathematicians understand what statistics scholarship looks like
