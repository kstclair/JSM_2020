### Abstract

Many graduate students are the product of research universities, where they learn a lot about research—but little about teaching. This is a shame because teaching is a fulfilling career path for statisticians, one that comes with its own rewards, challenges, and rewarding challenges. It is time to bring teaching focused careers to light, and this panel will do just that. You’ll learn about the day-to-day life of teachers, the job expectations they face, and the career paths that have led our panelists to careers in research universities, liberal arts colleges, and industry. We will share our experiences on how to find a teaching job, navigate the recruitment process, network, earn promotions, and—above all else—how to prepare yourself to be a good teacher.
